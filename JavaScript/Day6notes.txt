Function is a body of statements that can take parameters and return value

3 ways of definig functions in javascript
----------------------------------------------------------
.using Function keyword
syntax:
       function <functionName>(param1,param2,....paramN)
{

  .......statements....

}

->we should not return Return types


.using key-value or name-body association
syntax:
       var <variableName> =>(param1,param2,.......,paramN)
{
 
   .......statements........
}

.using the build-in function class
syntax:
        var <variableName>=new Function("function expression");


A function can be passed as a parameter to another function.It is called as a call-back function.There are 2 types

   ->manual call-back function
   ->automated call-back function (The fucntion automatically called by the browser)

Javascript provides 3 extended UI functions 
     ->window.alert() --For displaying information message or Warning



DOM-Document object Model
       .HTML tags are treated as objects
       .DOM mechanism allows a brwoser understand the structure of a typical HTML document
       .Browser has to understand the structure before the doucment is shown on the screen



.A DOM tree is collection of nodes.Every node is an object that represents an HTML tag
.Every node may have child nodes to streych the tree futher
.Every DOM tree has a root node,which is HTML node


DOM Tree->.Helps the browser to understand the structure
         .DOM Tree is created by the browser when a html file is displyed
         .Any HTMl tag can either have a name or an ID or somethimes both of them

How to navigation or traversal happens in the tree?
      ->In-Order (When the depth of the tree is more)
      ->Post-Order (
      ->pre-order (when the depth of the tree is lesser)


How the nodes are selected?

     .By ID
     .BY name 


.DOM operations that can be performed

       document.createElement()
       appendchild()
       removechild()
       findElement()
